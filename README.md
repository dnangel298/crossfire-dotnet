# CrossFire Server (C# Version)
**Hello everyone!** This is an **ambitious project**. We have many goals yet to be achieved and we would **appreciate** any and all help. We are happy to make the **source code** of our server available, many of the Enum already created are in correct order and with their proper typing for writing packages. Use the server as you wish, we have no restrictions as long as you assign credits to this repository.

## Authentication on Login Server
The project still does not have any management for databases or simulators, the same to simulate the login server uses a static data for the purpose of tests. Later on, a whole interface for this management will be implemented.

Below is the data to perform the authentication.
